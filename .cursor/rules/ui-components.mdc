# UI Component Library

This project uses [shadcn/ui](mdc:https:/ui.shadcn.com) for UI components, which is a collection of reusable components built on top of Tailwind CSS.

## Component Usage

UI components are imported from the `@/components/ui` directory:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import { Card, CardContent, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card";
```

## Adding New Components

New shadcn components should be added using the following command:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

## Styling Conventions

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling components
- Use the `cn()` utility for conditionally joining classNames
- Follow the shadcn/ui styling patterns for consistency

## Common Components

The project uses these primary UI components:

- **Button**: For action triggers with various variants (primary, outline, ghost)
- **Input**: For text input fields
- **Card**: Container component with CardHeader, CardContent, and CardFooter
- **Toast**: For temporary notifications via the Sonner library

## Component Customization

Components can be customized in the `components.json` configuration file.
